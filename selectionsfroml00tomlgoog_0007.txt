SIGHT-READING is no longer a disputed point with
the best Latin teaehers. The time was, and not long
since, when nearly all the energy and time of the student

were‘devoted to the acquisition of much that aided and

more that hindered the intellectual life. No man could
believe more thoroughly than the editor os this hook in the

accurate and complete study of Latin grammar in the ’

preliminary work aa the foundation of future growth and
power. But he is, nevertheless‚ strongly of the opinion
that there is a marked differenoe between memorizing
the grammar and knowing the grammar. There must be
constant, oareful, thorough drill in grammatical forms,
rules, and principles. But the ready application of aequired
knowledge has a twofold influenoe‚ -it crystalizes and eon·
denses knowledge already possessed, though perhaps in
a dim and general form, and in addition is a valuahle
discipline in and of itsell. The best Latin teaehers are
agreed, Ι think, that sight-reading and a re-oomposition of
translations of standard and select passages are among the

best and surest means of leading pupils into the language.
