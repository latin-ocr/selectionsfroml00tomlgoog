and relation.

7. In determining the meanings of the words, start with
the leading or common meaning if possible. Its derived
meanings, ii required, will become plain with the unfolding
oi the sentence. With new words, or words seemingly
new, try to find their meaning by analysis, taking the stem
or root, the prelix and suffiri, and the force ol each. Leave
the words whose meaning cannot be ascertained in this
manner until the last, when the context may reveal it.

8. When a sentence consiste oi a portion within the
grasp oi the student and of a portion beyond his power, go
back to the beginning of the sentence and reread. Do
not iail to connect every sentence with those which have
preceded it. This will often throw light upon dark pas·
sagea. Finally, in sightreading, polish, especially at first,
Α cannot enter in as an element of translation, as in carefully

prepared work, nor ought this to be expected3 and yet in a

little time the crude and uncouth transferrings of idioms

ought to give way to translations, ready and reasonably

accurate; and a progress at once inspiring and helpful.
